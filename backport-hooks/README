ADJUSTMENT HOOKS USED BY KUBUNTU-BATCH-BACKPORT

The scripts that are used as hooks have to be executable files and will be run
in the debian directory of the package.

Please put any adjustments that need to me made to a package so it can be
backported into a script here

They are to be named as:
<pkg>-<backportrelease>
or
<backportrelease>
(will be run on all packages)
